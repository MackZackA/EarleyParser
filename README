The script is an unoptimized version of Earley parser, where columns are presented as a list of lists of slots (where each rule, its weight, and its start position are stored). 

To run the script, use the command: "python3 [Grammar] [Sentences]"

More detailed illustrations of functions and data structures are commented in the script.
